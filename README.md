# Module-8-Challenge
 This TypeScript command-line app, Vehicle Builder, lets users create and interact with vehicles (cars, motorbikes, trucks). Users can create/select a vehicle, perform actions, and see results in the command line. The app uses TypeScript classes and Inquirer for input. Includes a README with a link to a walkthrough video.
